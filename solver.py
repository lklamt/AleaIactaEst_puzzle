    Class to solve the Alea Iacta Est Riddle
    (https://www.knobelbox.com/geduldsspiele/jean-claude-constantin/legepuzzle/5743/alea-iacta-est)

    The riddle works as follow:
    The board is a square of 7x7 squares. Each Square is filled with a number from 1 to 6 (each 7 times present);
    7 squares are left empty (board layout can be found under "INPUT/board.json"; emtpy fields --> 0).
    Additionally, the game consists of a set of tiles.
    Each tile can be found under "Input/tiles.json" (1 -> part of tile).

    The player first rolls 6 dices. The player then tries to assemble the 6 dices on fields with the corresponding
    number while filling all other fields of the board with the tiles.
    Finally, only a single field without a number has to be left empty.

    The vendor claims all combinations of dices have a solution.
    In contrast, this solver does not find a solution when the dice shows six times the "2".

    The solver works in two steps:
    Firstly, it creates a list of all combinations for the given combinations of dices, while simultanouesly adding
    all combinations for the left over empty field.

    Secondly, based on this list of possible combinations for the dices, the solver recursively tries to add one tile
    after another while complying to no collisions and not leaving single fields free and "isolated".

    Due to the vast amount of combinations in step 1 for certain combinations of dices the solver will likely not
    converge. For Example for the combination 1,2,3,4,5,6 on the dices we will have 7^7 = 823543 start combinations.
    For other combinations like 6,6,6,6,6,6 we have much less combinations to place the dices (+empty field)
    on the board (49). For these cases the algorithm will find all possible solutions within a few minutes.

    Thus, one can define a break criterion when running step two by defining after how many solutions the
    algorithm shall stop.
